This is a simple falling sandwich catching game. The game draws the player model, the sandwich, and the text on screen and the sandwich falls. The game checks where the sandwich is to see if the sandwich has been eaten or has fallen past the canvas, then resets the sandwich. There is also a lives system (called “bites missed”) that tracks how many times the player has dropped the sandwich. The game stops when this hits 0.
